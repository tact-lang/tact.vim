Adds syntax highlighting, grammar completion and miscellaneous support for the
Tact programming language <https://tact-lang.org/> to Vim 8+ and Neovim.

Tact is a new programming language for TON blockchain that is focused on
efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to
be a good fit for smart contracts, because it is a statically typed language
with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.


FEATURES                                                       *tact-features*

- |tact-syntax-highlighting|, which closely follows Tact specification in its Ohm grammar file <https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/src/grammar/grammar.ohm>
- |tact-indentation|, as well as single-line and multi-line comments support
- |tact-basic-indentation-&-folding-support|
- |tact-compiler-integration-support|
- |tact-abbreviations| in INSERT mode
- |tact-auto-completion| (omnifunc/completefunc) support of static (global) and extension (methods on types) functions from stdlib, and all of the basic grammar
    (use `ctrl-x ctrl-o` to trigger it or setup shortcuts as you wish)
- Basic linting, which automatically triggers on omnicompletion. Don’t forget to close your braces {}, parenthesis () and names, or use keyword completion instead ;)

See the highlighting showcase below (uses `One Dark` color scheme). Note, that
you can |tact-disable-highlighting-of-identifiers|, if you want to :)




INSTALLATION                                               *tact-installation*


FIRST TIME IN VIM 8+? READ THIS! ~

Click to see ~

Assuming you don’t have any configuration in the `.vimrc` file, it’s nicer
to setup some sane defaults first before using this (or any other) plugin.
Also, the following mini-guide will use the built-in package management for Vim
8+ and won’t introduce anything fancy.

Steps: 1. Get yourself a Vim of version 8+ installed and make sure to have git
installed and present on your path as well 2. Create a `~/.vimrc` file (or
`~/_vimrc` if you’re on Windows) 3. Without such file there were sourced
defaults by the Vim authors, but once it’s created, we have to put them back
explicitly by adding those lines in and saving changes :w

>vim
    unlet! skip_defaults_vim
    source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim
<

1. Whilewe’re here, let’s add some `tact.vim`-specific stuff in as well. This time save and quit as we no longer need to add anything (:wq):

>vim
    let g:tact_style_guide = 1  " Enabling default indentation style
    
    " the following is optional and added purely for your convenience:
    inoremap <silent> <c-space> <c-x><c-o>  " Open completion menu on ctrl-space
<

Note: on macOS the `<c-space>` is already bound in the system, so unless the
terminal intercepts it you’ll have to use a different keybinding.

1. It’s also nice to source in the extended defaults provided by the tpope/vim-sensible <https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible>. To do so, let’s use the built-in package manager:

On Linux, macOS or BSD:

>bash
    git clone "https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git" ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start/sensible
<

On Windows, do this in PowerShell:

>powershell
    git clone 'https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git' $HOME\vimfiles\pack\tpope\start\sensible
<

1. Finally, let’s install tact.vim <https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim>

OnLinux, macOS or BSD:

>bash
    git clone "https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim.git" ~/.vim/pack/tact-lang/start/tact
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags $HOME/.vim/pack/tact-lang/start/tact/doc" -c q
<

On Windows, do this in PowerShell:

>powershell
    git clone 'https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim.git' $HOME\vimfiles\pack\tact-lang\start\tact
    vim -u NONE -c 'helptags $HOME\vimfiles\pack\tact-lang\start\tact\doc' -c q
<

1. Start the Vim in the valid Tact project <https://docs.tact-lang.org/> to be able to use `:Tact` command for easy compilation or simply provide any `.tact` file otherwise. Happy coding 


BUILT-INPACKAGE MANAGER IN VIM 8+ ~

Click to see ~

This is the recommended installation method if you use at least Vim 8 and you
don’t use another package manager. More about Vim’s built-in package
manager: `:help packages` <https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages>.

For Linux/macOS:

>sh
    git clone "https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim.git" ~/.vim/pack/tact-lang/start/tact
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags $HOME/.vim/pack/tact-lang/start/tact/doc" -c q
<

For Windows/PowerShell:

>powershell
    git clone 'https://github.com/tact-lang/tact.vim.git' $HOME\vimfiles\pack\tact-lang\start\tact
    vim -u NONE -c 'helptags $HOME\vimfiles\pack\tact-lang\start\tact\doc' -c q
<

Don’t forget to restart Vim after :)


VUNDLE ~

Click to see ~

Info about it: Vundle repository <https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim>.

Steps: 1. Add `tact.vim` to your plugin list in `~/.vimrc` (or `~/_vimrc` on
Windows) by inserting the line that starts with `Plugin`

>vim
    call vundle#begin()
      " ...
      Plugin 'tact-lang/tact.vim'
      " ...
    call vundle#end()
<

1. RestartVim or run `:source ~/.vimrc`.
2. Run `:PluginInstall`.


VIM-PLUG ~

Click to see ~

Info about it: vim-plug repository <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>.

Steps: 1. Add `tact.vim` to your plugin list in `~/.vimrc` (or `~/_vimrc` on
Windows) by inserting the line that starts with `Plug`

>vim
    call plug#begin()
      "...
      Plug 'tact-lang/tact.vim'
      "...
    call plug#end()
<

1. RestartVim or run `:source ~/.vimrc`.
2. Run `:PlugInstall`.


LAZY.NVIM (NEOVIM-ONLY) ~

Click to see ~

Info about it: - lazy.nvim repository <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>. -
Installation of lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-installation>

Steps: 1. Add `tact.vim` to your lazy.nvim setup in `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`
(or `~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.lua` on Windows):

>lua
     require('lazy').setup({
       -- ...
       { 'tact-lang/tact.vim' },
       -- ...
     }, {})
<

1. Run `:Lazy`.


CONFIGURATION                                             *tact-configuration*


COMPLETION ~

By default this plugin sets an `omnifunc` option to provide auto-completions by
triggering CTRL-xCTRL-o in INSERT mode. However, if you’re using an LSP
client for Tact language, it may overwrite this option and disable the
completion and basic linting capabilities provided by this plugin alongside of
it.

In order to prevent that behaviour you may want to bind completion features of
this plugin to a `competefunc` option (which is quite conveniently triggered by
CTRL-xCTRL-u in INSERT mode). Add the following to your `~/.vimrc` (or
`~/_vimrc` on Windows) if you’d like to prefer and bind `completefunc` over
`omnifunc`

>vim
    " CTRL-x CTRL-u instead of CTRL-x CTRL-o
    let g:tact_prefer_completefunc = 1
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.g.tact_prefer_completefunc = 1
<

Alternatively,add the following to the `init` key of your `lazy.nvim` config:

>lua
    require('lazy').setup({
      -- ...
      {
        'tact-lang/tact.vim',
        init = function()
          -- ...
          vim.g.tact_prefer_completefunc = 1
          -- ...
        end,
      },
      -- ...
    }, {})
<


INDENTATION ~

Add the following to your `~/.vimrc` (or `~/_vimrc` on Windows) to enable
preferred indentation style for Tact:

>vim
    let g:tact_style_guide = 1
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.g.tact_style_guide = 1
<

Alternatively, add the following to the `init` key of your `lazy.nvim` config:

>lua
    require('lazy').setup({
      -- ...
      {
        'tact-lang/tact.vim',
        init = function()
          -- ...
          vim.g.tact_style_guide = 1
          -- ...
        end,
      },
      -- ...
    }, {})
<


HIGHLIGHTING ~

If you want to disable highlighting of identifiers: variables and constants
(but not structures), add the following option:

>vim
    let g:tact_blank_identifiers = 1
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.g.tact_blank_identifiers = 1
<

Alternatively, add the following to the `init` key of your `lazy.nvim` config:

>lua
    require('lazy').setup({
      -- ...
      {
        'tact-lang/tact.vim',
        init = function()
          -- ...
          vim.g.tact_blank_identifiers = 1
          -- ...
        end,
      },
      -- ...
    }, {})
<

To disable highlighting of structures (names of traits, messages, contracts and
structs), add the following:

>vim
    let g:tact_blank_structures = 1
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.g.tact_blank_structures = 1
<

Alternatively, add the following to the `init` key of your `lazy.nvim` config:

>lua
    require('lazy').setup({
      -- ...
      {
        'tact-lang/tact.vim',
        init = function()
          -- ...
          vim.g.tact_blank_structures = 1
          -- ...
        end,
      },
      -- ...
    }, {})
<


FORMATTING ~

Basic code formatting can be done by a series of Vim motions: `gg=G` (plus
Ctrl-o twice to return to the original cursor position), or by invoking a
`:TactFmt` command, which does all that for you _without_ messing up with your
cursor. Use both with caution, as Vim-native indentation handling is known to
be prone to errors.


FOLDING ~

To enable code-folding add the following snippet. This one might have an impact
on editing performance, proceed with caution:

>vim
    augroup tact_folding
        au!
        au FileType tact setlocal foldmethod=syntax
    augroup END
<

Neovim-only ~

Make a `~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin` directory
(`~/AppData/Local/nvim/after/ftplugin`) and put the file `tact.lua` in it with
the following contents:

>lua
    vim.opt.foldmethod = "syntax"
    vim.opt.foldenable = false  -- disables automatic folding on file opening
<


ABBREVIATIONS ~

To trigger an abbreviation, type it in followed by punctuation such as a space
or comma, and it would get expanded into a code snippet. It’s advised to use
space for this as it usually produces best results.

These abbreviations (and auto-completions of their names) are available right
away:

1. `a_fun` — expands to the function declaration
2. `a_extfun` — expands to the extension function declaration
3. `a_mutfun` — expands to the mutable function declaration
4. `a_natfun` — expands to the native function declaration
5. `a_co` — expands to the contract declaration
6. `a_tr` — expands to the trait declaration
7. `a_st` — expands to the struct declaration
8. `a_me` — expands to the message declaration
9. `a_se` — expands to send(SendParameters{…}) call

**Keep in mind** that abbreviations are always there and you can always type
them in, even if they’re not shown by omnicompletion when deemed not suitable
for the current completion context.

To avoid expansion in INSERT mode, type Ctrl-V after the last character of the
abbreviation (on Windows, type Ctrl-Q instead of Ctrl-V).

To completely disable abbreviations provided by this plugin only, add this to
your `~/.vimrc` (or `~/_vimrc` on Windows):

>vim
    let g:tact_disable_abbreviations = 1
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.g.tact_disable_abbreviations = 1
<

Alternatively, add the following to the `init` key of your `lazy.nvim` config:

>lua
    require('lazy').setup({
      -- ...
      {
        'tact-lang/tact.vim',
        init = function()
          -- ...
          vim.g.tact_disable_abbreviations = 1
          -- ...
        end,
      },
      -- ...
    }, {})
<


LINTING ~

Simply run `:Tact` command to try to compile using Tacts’ compiler and look
for errors. See |tact-usage-section| for more info on the command.


MISCELLANEOUS ~

For the ease of omnicompletion usage, you may want to add this or similar
bindings, but they are not obligatory to use the plugin:

>vim
    " Open omnicompletion menu on ctrl-space
    inoremap <silent> <c-space> <c-x><c-o>
<

Neovim-only ~

>lua
    vim.keymap.set('i', '<c-space>', '<c-x><c-o>', { noremap = true, silent = true})
<

Note, that on macOS there’s a default system-wide keyboard shortcut for
CtrlSpace (`^space`). You may want to change it to be CmdSpace instead or use
the different binding in Vim.

At times when omnicompletion (CTRL-xCTRL-o) can’t complete much it fallbacks
to keyword completion (CTRL-xCTRL-n). But that’s not always the case, so if
omnicompletion doesn’t show anything, try keyword one!


USAGE                                                             *tact-usage*

For your convenience there’s a `:Tact` command available whenever you open
any `.tact` files. It tries to run the `build` script from your `package.json`
project file, which, as shown in this official example here
<https://docs.tact-lang.org/start#getting-started-from-scratch>, should invoke
a Tact compiler. You’re expected to have a Node.js of the current LTS (or
later) version installed on your system, alongside of `npm` for the `:Tact`
command to work.

It’s generally recommended to go over the example
<https://docs.tact-lang.org/start#getting-started-from-scratch>, as it shows
how to get started with Tact. Alternatively, use the official project template
<https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template>either copy or create a new
repository based off of it.

Wish you good luck and fun exploring Tact!
